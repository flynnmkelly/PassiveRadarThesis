Affordable and effecient passive radar based detection, tracking and situational awareness technology is increasing in demand in a range of sectors and academia. As software-defined radio (SDR) technology becomes more widespread and single-board computers (SBCs) continue to gain processing power, the possibility of deploying passive radar systems in an embedded, cost-effective manner has emerged as a critical area of research and commercial development. The growing need for such systems is particularly evident in scenarios where traditional, expensive PC hardware setups at remote receiver (RX) locations are impractical or cost-prohibitive. This has created a specific need for streamlined, scalable systems that can function independently and effectively in various environments.

In response to these demands, this project aims to design and implement a low-cost, embedded passive radar detection testbed prototype system that leverages a digital broadcast signal as an illuminator of opportunity. The chosen approach involves utilizing existing embedded IoT hardware in combination with established digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and radar filtering algorithms. This integrated solution is intended to form a single embedded Linux testbed capable of handling both signal sampling and processing, along with sampling networking thereby eliminating the reliance on costly and complex physical hardware at each RX location.

Key outcomes of this research include the successful detection of aerial vehicles within controlled environments, an analysis of the system's latency, and a comprehensive evaluation of the overall cost-effectiveness of the design. The implications of this work include offering valuable insights into the scalability and cost-quality balance that can be achieved in future passive radar system implementations. Moreover, the project aims to deliver a re-usable, scaleable testbed which can be used to further develop and test passive radar based detection and situational awareness systems.
